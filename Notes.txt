//🌐Hooks
📋 Hooks are functions to use some react features in functional components
📋 Hooks are functions that make functional components work like class components



🔍useState ->  useState hook is used to add state in functional components. 
📋 state is nothing but just values or variables of your component
📋 It returns an array with the current state value and a function to update that value.
📋 Updating state with useState involves calling the function returned by the hook and passing the new value.
📋 Array destructuring can be used to simplify the code.
📋 useState can handle different types of data (boolean, number, text, object, array).



🔍useEffect
📋 useEffect is used to perform side effect in our component
📋 side effects are actions which are performed with the outside world
📋 We perform a side effect when we need to reach outside of our React components to do something

📋 useEffect is used for side effects in components, such as fetching data from API, updating the DOM and window, or using timers, setTimeout and setIntervals.
It combines componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

📋 useEffect(callback, dependencies)
📋 callback-> function (side effect logic) = what to run
📋 dependencies-> Array of variables  = when to run
📋 useEffect runs on every render, which means when the count changes render happens and we can control that by dependencies

📋 useEffect has three variations:- 
    without dependencies (runs on every change), 
    with an empty array (runs once on mount), when our component gets render first time => it is useful when we fetch data from API or server, that will fetch data when the component gets render first time
    and with variables (runs on mount and when specified variables change).

📋 Cleanup functions in useEffect are essential to handle scenarios where side effects need to be stopped or cleaned up, preventing performance issues.



🔍useContext
📋 useContext hook is used to manage global data in react application, like Global state, Themes, Services, User Settings
📋 useContext will help us to create global data for our react application and we don't have to pass the data through all the components 
we can access the data in all component whenever we need it 
📋 if you want to pass data just for child component, then you can use props

📋 create context require three steps:
    1) Creating the context (using createContext()) 
    2) Providing the context  (u need to decide which components can access this context with the use of context.provider)
    3) Consuming the context  (import that context and pass that context inside useContext() hook)




🔍useRef
📋useRef is allow us to create mutable variables which will not re-render the component
📋useRef allows us to direct access DOM elements without writing  Document.getElementById/className by ref attribute

📋const variableName = useRef(initialVlaue) 


🔍useReducer
